# Violence Detection using CNN + LSTM neural network

## Problems
To detect Fights in a recorded clip/Video...


## Introduction:

Today, the amount of public violence has increased dramatically. As much in high schools as in the street. This has resulted in the ubiquitous use of surveillance cameras. This has helped the authorities to identify these events and take the necessary measures. But almost all systems today require the human-inspection of these videos to identify such events, which is virtually inefficient. It is therefore necessary to have such a practical system that can automatically monitor and identify the surveillance videos. The development of various deep learning techniques, thanks to the availability of large data sets and computational resources, has resulted in a historic change in the community of computer vision. Various techniques have been developed to address problems such as object detection, recognition, tracking, action recognition, legend generation, etc. However, despite recent developments in deep learning, very few techniques based on deep learning have been proposed to address the problem of detecting violence from videos.



## Dataset
•	Collected raw surveillance videos from YouTube, sliced them into clips within 5s at 20 fps, and labeled each clip as Violent or Non-Violent Behavior。

•	Finally created 1600 clips and 160,000 frames as a new data set for real-world violent behavior detection under surveillance camera.
